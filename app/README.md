# MusicBee

## Installing

For testing purposes it is preferred to use a separate instance of MusicBee than the main on.

Download the portable edition of MusicBee from [here](https://www.getmusicbee.com/downloads/) and
make sure that you install it so that the `MusicBee` folder is in this directory.

The build script will automatically copy the plugin to the Plugins folder.
